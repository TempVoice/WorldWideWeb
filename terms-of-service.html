						<h3> Terms of Service </h3>
						<p> Effective: July 24, 2022.
							Last updated: July 24, 2022. <br>
						</p>

						<p> Imprint: https://tempvoice.xyz/imprint <br>
						Privacy Policy: https://tempvoice.xyz/privacy-policy
						</p>

						<h4> 1. Introduction </h4>
						<p> Thanks for being interested in using TempVoice (ID: 762217899355013120). Before doing so, you should carefully read, understand and accept these Terms of Service and the corresponding Privacy Policy (accessible at https://tempvoice.xyz/privacy-policy, collectively referred to as "Terms").

						<p> This is a legal agreement between the TempVoice Development ("We", "Our", "Bot", "TempVoice") and you ("Your"). By using this Discord bot, its website and other related products (collectively referred to as "TempVoice", "Bot" or "Service"), you are agreeing to the following Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.

						<p> To fully understand and being able to agree to these Terms, you will have to read, understand and accept Discord Inc. ("Discord")'s Terms of Service (accessible at https://discord.com/terms), first.

						<p> TempVoice reserves the right to update these Terms, which may be done for reasons that include, but are not limited to, complying with changes to the law or reflecting enhancements to TempVoice. If the changes affect your usage of TempVoice or your legal rights, a message is sent into the "#notification" channel (ID: 936380235086196766) of TempVoice's Discord Support Server (ID: 904322845646135317, accessible at https://tempvoice.xyz/support). You will be notified no less than 14 days before the changes take effect. Unless I state otherwise, your continued use of TempVoice after the modifications are posted will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to those changes. You agree that you won't be notified on changes to these Terms when not being part of the support server or disabled notifications of this server. Either way, it is highly recommended to periodically check on these Terms to ensure that you still agree to them.

						<h4> 2. About this service </h4>
						<p> TempVoice is a bot for the chat and social platform "Discord" (accessible at https://discord.com), provided by Discord Inc. This service allows you to make use of Discord's public API (its documentation is accessible at https://discord.dev/, including its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy).

						<p> TempVoice is strictly following Discord's "Developer terms", does not want, is not trying to and is not knowingly abusing any of Discord's services. <br> <br> YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THIS SERVICE OR ITS PROVIDED FEATURES OTHER THAN INTENDED. YOU MAY NOT USE TempVoice TO SEND MESSAGES TO VOICE-IN-TEXT CHANNELS TO ADVERTISE TO USERS, ABUSE TempVoice IN ANY OTHER WAY COULD BE AGAINST THIS OR DISCORD'S TERMS. <br> <br> If you find out that someone is abusing TempVoice's features, please let us know as soon as possible.

						<h4> 3. License </h4>
						<p> You may use TempVoice and its services for any purpose, including commercial use, if not stated otherwise in this Terms. You may not reverse-engineer or otherwise attempt to derive source code from TempVoice. When mentioning or using brand features of TempVoice outside of Discord, you need to somehow mention that TempVoice is accessible at https://tempvoice.xyz.

						<h4> 4. Restrictions on your use of TempVoice's services </h4>
						<p> TempVoice allows you to send interface messages into Discord channels without being able to clearly determine the responsible person of this message, therefore the owner of a Discord server is liable for messages or actions taken by the bot.

						<h4> 5.1. Tiers </h4>
						<p> TempVoice is completely free but offers Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/) tiers to support the development and higher limitations:

						<ul>
							<li>2.99€ (+VAT) TempVoice Premium +</li>
							<li>3.99€ (+VAT) TempVoice Premium ++</li>
							<li>4.99€ (+VAT) TempVoice Premium +++</li>
						</ul>

						<h4> 5.2. Conditions </h4>
						<p> Before subscribing to a Patreon Tier, you agree to the following conditions:

						<p> TempVoice Premium subscription is on a monthly basis - per server(s). You are paying at the first day you subscribe and every 1th of each month. It can take until the next full our cyclus to get validated and be able to activate premium on a server(s) of your choise.

						<h4> 5.3. Outages </h4>
						<p> Please see section 6.

						<h4> 6. Outages, termination and general service </h4>
						<p> TempVoice and its services are completely free, except its TempVoice Premium option (section 5). We are actively developing new features and fix bugs to improve TempVoice and your user experience. Therefore I may add or remove features. While I try to avoid disruptions, I cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or change to the service and your server's settings and set up messages ("Templates") may not be retrievable due to such outages or changes. I am not liable for any such outages or service changes, especially because TempVoice is a free service, apart from TempVoice Premium.

						<p> You are free to stop using TempVoice's services at any time for any reason by kicking TempVoice from your Discord server.

						<p> The TempVoice Development Team reserves the right to stop you using TempVoice's service with or without notice for any reason.

						<h4> 6.1. Service Quality </h4>
						<p> We are trying to provide TempVoice as reliable as possible. If you experienced one or multiple outages which are willing to add up to 24 hours of TempVoice Premium Option in case you already subscribed. All you need to do is to ask for it on the Discord Server.

						<p> TempVoice may also use content from other websites or services while not being affiliated or supporting them.
